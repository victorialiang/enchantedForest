Project Proposal

My project is an interactive maze game based on the story of Little Red Riding Hood. The game will generate a random maze each time the game is played. The user will direct the character Red who is trying to find her way through the forest to get to her grandma's house. The main display will be the first person perspective that takes in information from the player's position on the maze to create a picture of what the character sees as she is walking through the forest. When the maze branches into different paths, this will be reflected in the first person perspective so the user can choose which path to take. On the sidebar of the display, the user can see a bird's eye view of the forest maze, and the character's position in it.

I plan to have the character interact with multiple other characters along the way to make the user experience more interesting. Since the forest is enchanted, every time the character tries to move back she will be put in a random location on a new maze.

I plan to only use Tkinter to create graphics. To take the project a step further, I plan to animate the leaves and branches of the trees to move as if they are blowing in the wind. The main problems that I need to solve are creating the randomly generated maze, getting the perspective to match each other, and making the graphics animations. I plan to solve this problem by creating the maze using the method from 112 notes, then matching that maze to a new 2d list of booleans. The first-person perspective will use the list of booleans to match the bird's eye view of the maze. I plan to make the graphics animations by combining layers of geometric shapes.
